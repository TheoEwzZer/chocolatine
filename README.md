# Chocolatine

Whatever your opinions might be, this is a _chocolatine_.

But what purpose does it serve? It allows you to go through the day and through your work better. In other words, it facilitate your work and allows you to focus on things that matter (discussing its name does not pertain to this category).

Your repositories are hosted on GitHub, and GitHub has an intuitive way of automating the launch of pre-defined actions, triggered by events of your choice. It is, in the same way as chocolatines, a great way to facilitate and enhance your development and your workflow.

In this project, you will setup a GitHub Actions workflow to enforce good practices and diverse rules in a repository.

```text
GitHub Actions are free and unlimited for public repositories, and free up to 2,000 minutes
per month for personal private repositories, which is quite generous!
```

## TECHNICAL DETAILS

You will have to turn in a single YAML workflow file named ```chocolatine.yml```, placed either:

- at the root of your repository;
- or in the ```.github/workflows``` folder.

**Your workflow must be usable with your different Epitech projects and their respective technologies and associated tools.**

```text
For this project, the only external actions allowed are actions/checkout and pixta-dev/
repository-mirroring-action.
All other external actions (which you can find on the GitHub marketplace for example)
are strictly forbidden.
```

```text
If particular settings or elements are not specified or addressed in the subject, you are
free to do as you please with them.
```

### EVALUATION

Your workflow will be tested by copying your ```chocolatine.yml``` file, **and only this file**, into a test repository’s ```.github/workflows``` directory.
Make then sure that the workflow is **self-contained** and does **not need any external files**.

### SECRETS

You might need to use secured data or values to make your workflow successfully run.
In this case, you **must** use secrets.

```text
If any hardcoded sensitive value is found in your workflow file, your entire project will
fail. You have been warned.
```

## FEATURES

Using a GitHub Actions workflow, you will need to implement a set of features.

The workflow must be run on every **push** and on every **pull request** creation, **unless** the branch name starts with ```ga-ignore-```, in which case the workflow must not be run at all.

Furthermore, **each job must** :

- start by **checking out the repository** to the relevant branch;
- only be run if the **previous job has succeeded**.

```text
The order in which the jobs are expected to be run is the order in which they are defined
below in the subject.
```

### ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

You need to define several environment variables, available at the **workflow level**.

- ```MIRROR_URL:``` the URL of the Epitech repository which will act as a mirror;
- ```EXECUTABLES:``` a comma-separated list of the paths of the executables expected to be produced (it can have a single executable, like ```"pushswap"``` or ```"lib/my/libmy.a"```, or several, like ```"antman/antman,giantman/giantman"```).

```text
All environment variables’ values will be strings.
```

```text
"available at the workflow level" means that the environment variables must be only
defined once, and be available for all jobs and steps of the workflow.
```

### JOBS

#### CHECKING THE CODING STYLE

Create a job with a ```check_coding_style``` ID that runs in ```aghcr.io/epitech/coding-style-checker:latestDocker``` container, and that in order:

- runs the coding style checker script with the following command:

```bash
check.sh $(pwd) $(pwd)
```

- if any, displays each coding style error as an _error annotation_ ;
- makes the job fail if there are any coding style errors.

```text
By using the appropriate error annotation parameters, you will be able to click on it and
be taken to the precise line of the offending file.
```

#### CHECKING THAT THE PROGRAM COMPILES CORRECTLY

Create a job with a ```check_program_compilation``` ID that, in order:

- launches make at the root of the repository (this step must have a 2 minutes timeout);
- launches (on a separate step) ```make clean``` at the root of the repository;
- verifies that each file specified in the ```EXECUTABLES``` environment variable exists and is executable (the job must fail if any of the executables is not there, or not executable).

**This job must must be run in an [epitechcontent/epitest-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/epitechcontent/epitest-docker) Docker container.**

#### RUNNING TESTS (BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT HEROES DO)

Create a job with a ```run_tests``` ID that launches make tests_run at the root of the repository (this step must have a 2 minutes timeout).

**This job must must be run in an [epitechcontent/epitest-docker](https://hub.docker.com/r/epitechcontent/epitest-docker) Docker container.**

#### PUSHING TO THE MIRROR REPOSITORY

Create a job with a ```push_to_mirror``` ID that runs a mirroring to the repository specified in the ```MIRROR_URL``` environment variable.

It must use a secret named ```GIT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY``` to specify the SSH private key to use.

**This job must only be executed when a push is made to the repository.**
